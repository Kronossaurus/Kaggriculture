"""Frozen snapshot of `main.py` as submitted to Kaggle on 2026-08-18 (see
`scripts/pool_winrate.py`'s DEFAULT_POOL and the module docstring's snapshot
convention in `reference/main_dump_sell.py`). Captures the state after the
planting-priority-under-the-gate fix (PLANT_PRIORITY_UNDER_GATE lets a fresh
PLANT candidate compete with routine maintenance instead of always losing to
it while owned land is under LAND_UTILIZATION_GATE -- measured +24% money /
100% win rate vs the pool's toughest opponent in a same-process 30-seed A/B).
A related market-order-slot-starvation fix was tried and reverted; see git
log around this commit and main.py's own docstring for the full
investigation history. Not maintained going forward -- a frozen comparison
point, not a second strategy to keep developing.

    priority order, so a unit works whichever is more urgent right now
    instead of being permanently assigned to one or the other (see the
    module docstring's Animal husbandry (attempt 3) note).

    `liquidating` (close to the last day, see the module docstring's Endgame
    liquidation note) swaps water's and shed-return's priority: watering a
    crop that won't finish growing in time is wasted effort, while getting
    already-harvested produce into the shed guarantees it can still be sold.

    A tile with `consecutive_unwatered >= 1` (kaggriculture.py: missing
    water two days running turns a PLANT into a WEED, and a fresh planting
    already starts pre-loaded at 1 -- "the planting day counts as
    unwatered") is one miss away from being lost outright, so its water
    candidate jumps to harvest's own priority (0) instead of the routine
    `water_priority` -- see the module docstring's Neglected-tile urgency
    note. This is what actually stops distant land from quietly losing
    crops to neglect, not geography: a unit chasing marginally-closer
    routine chores near the shed will still lose to a genuinely at-risk
    tile regardless of how far away it is.

    `plant_priority` (PLANT_PRIORITY or PLANT_PRIORITY_UNDER_GATE, chosen
    once per turn in `agent()`) is the priority a fresh PLANT candidate
    sorts at -- see the module docstring's Planting priority under the
    gate note: priority strictly outranks distance in this function's sort
    key, so at its baseline (4, below every maintenance chore except
    routine water) a single turn with more outstanding water/harvest/weed/
    animal-care work than there are units leaves *zero* units ever reaching
    a PLANT candidate, no matter how many empty tiles sit right next to
    them.

    Every candidate carries a precomputed `sort_dist` (its 4th field) rather
    than the sort key recomputing raw distance uniformly: a fresh PLANT
    candidate gets its raw distance inflated by how utilized its quadrant
    already is (`quadrant_util`), nudging new plantings toward whichever
    quadrant is most neglected instead of always the literal nearest empty
    tile -- see the module docstring's spatial clustering (crops) note. Every
    other candidate type keeps plain, unadjusted distance.

    Confirmed in a second, unrelated replay too, so a real and recurring
    cost, not a one-off. Root cause as best diagnosed: this function's
    `committed` (shed tokens + live, ignoring empty structures) and
    _AnimalPlanner's own `_committed()` (live + empty structures, ignoring
    shed tokens) are two different counts that can drift apart, letting
    purchases outrun confirmed structure availability. Two fix attempts
    (gating purchases on empty-structure availability directly, at buffer
    0 and buffer 1 tokens of slack) both measured *worse* than this
    unfixed version in 10-seed pool comparisons against the exact same
    trimmed pool -- head-to-head against `reference/main_fertilizer_
    selling_submitted_20260817.py` went 9/10 -> 8/10 -> 5/10 seeds won as
    the fix got progressively less permissive, the opposite of the
    expected direction, and the regression reproduced across two separate
    runs of the buffer=1 variant. Not fully explained why gating more
    correctly against stranding costs more throughput than the stranding
    itself -- reverted rather than ship an unexplained regression chasing
    a bug worth an estimated ~$1,900/game (small next to the 20-50%
    swings the fix attempts caused). Worth another look with a clearer
    hypothesis before retrying."""
